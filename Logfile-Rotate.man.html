<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
I have used the name space of <EM>Logfile</EM> package by <EM>Ulrich Pfeifer</EM>, as the use of this module closely relates to the processing logfiles.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_new">new</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
<A HREF="#item_new">new</A> accepts five arguments, <CODE>File</CODE>, <CODE>Count</CODE>, <CODE>Gzip</CODE>, <CODE>Signal</CODE> and
<CODE>Dir</CODE> with only <CODE>File</CODE> being mandatory.  <A HREF="#item_new">new</A> will open and lock the file, so you may co-ordinate the processing of the
file with rotating it. The file is closed and unlocked when the object is
destroyed, so you can do this explicitly by <CODE>undef</CODE>'ing the object.  

<P>
The <CODE>Signal</CODE> argument allows you to pass a function reference to this method, which you
may use as a callback for any further processing you want after the rotate
is completed. For example, you may notify the process writing to the file
that it has been rotated.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_rotate">rotate()</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This method will copy the file passed in <A HREF="#item_new">new</A> to a file of the same name, with a numeric extension and truncate the
original file to zero length. The numeric extension will range from 1 up to
the value specified by Count, or 7 if none is defined, with 1 being the
most recent file. When Count is reached, the older file is discarded in a
FIFO (first in, first out) fashion. If the argument <CODE>Dir</CODE> was given, all old files will be placed in the specified directory.

<P>
The <CODE>Signal</CODE> function is the last step executed by the rotate method so the return code
of rotate will be the return code of the function you proved, or 1 by
default.

<P>
The copy function is implemented by using the <EM>File</EM> package, but I have had a few people suggest that they would prefer <EM>File</EM>. I'm still not decided on this as you would loose data if the move should
fail.  

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Optional_Compression">Optional Compression</A></H2>
<P>
If available <A HREF="#item_rotate">rotate</A> will also compress the file with the 
<EM>gzip</EM> program or the program passed as the <CODE>Gzip</CODE> argument. If no argument is defined it will also check the perl <EM>Config</EM> 
to determine if gzip is available on your system. In this case the <EM>gzip</EM> must be in your current path to succeed, and accept the C<STRONG>-f</STRONG> option.  

<P>
See the <A HREF="#WARNING">WARNING</A> section below.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Optional_Relocation_Directory">Optional Relocation Directory</A></H2>
<P>
If you specify an argument for <CODE>Dir</CODE> then the file being rotated will be relocated to the directory specified.
Along with any other files that may have been rotated previously. If the
directory name specified does not exist then it will be created with <CODE>0750</CODE> permissions. If you wish to have other permissions on the directory then I
would recommend you create the directory before using this module.

<P>
See the <A HREF="#WARNING">WARNING</A> section below.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="WARNING">WARNING</A></H1>
<P>
A system call is made to <EM>gzip</EM> this makes this module vulnerable to security problems if a rogue gzip is
in your path or <EM>gzip</EM> has been sabotaged. For this reason a STRONGLY RECOMMEND you DO NOT use
this module while you are ROOT, or specify the <CODE>Gzip</CODE> argument.

<P>
If you specify an argument for <CODE>Dir</CODE> and the directory name you pass does not exist, this module <STRONG>will create</STRONG> the directory with permissions <CODE>0750</CODE>.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DEPENDANCIES">DEPENDANCIES</A></H1>
<P>
See <EM>File</EM>.

<P>
If <CODE>Gzip</CODE> is being used it must create files with an extension of <CODE>.gz</CODE> for the file to be picked by the rotate cycle.
